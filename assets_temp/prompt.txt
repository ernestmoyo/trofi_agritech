# Build: Trofi AgriTech — Africa Agriculture Intelligence Platform

## Context

I am building a full-stack web platform called **Trofi AgriTech** — a comprehensive data and analytics system that tracks agriculture across the African continent (55 AU member states). The platform serves policymakers, researchers, development agencies, agribusiness stakeholders, and technology innovators.

The platform has **five core modules**:

---

Track, compare, and analyze agriculture-related policies across all 55 AU member states.

**Data dimensions:**
- Policy name, country, enactment date, status (draft / enacted / amended / repealed)
- Policy category: land tenure, subsidies & inputs, trade policy, food safety & standards, irrigation & water, extension services, climate adaptation, mechanization, seed systems, livestock, digital agriculture & AI
- Alignment tags to continental frameworks (Malabo Declaration, CAADP, AfCFTA agriculture protocols, AU Agenda 2063, AU Digital Transformation Strategy)
- Implementing agency, budget allocation (where available), review/sunset dates
- Policy documents (PDF upload + metadata extraction)

**Features:**
- Filterable, searchable policy registry with country and regional (RECs: SADC, EAC, ECOWAS, COMESA, etc.) views
- Policy timeline visualization per country
- Cross-country policy comparison matrix
- Policy gap analysis: which countries lack policies in critical categories

### MODULE 3: Post-Harvest Loss (PHL) Tracker

Monitor and analyze post-harvest losses across value chains and geographies.

**Data dimensions:**
- Commodity and commodity group
- Loss stage: harvesting, handling, storage, transport, processing, market/retail
- Loss type: quantitative (weight/volume), qualitative (nutritional, economic value)
- Loss rate (%) and absolute loss (MT and USD equivalent)
- Country, sub-national region (where granularity available)

## Deliverable

Build this as a **Next.js 14+ App Router** application. Start with:

1. **Database schema** (Prisma) covering all five modules with proper relations, enums, and indexes
2. **Seed data** for at least 5 countries across all modules (including sample AI solutions, readiness scores, and investment data) so the platform is demonstrable
3. **Full frontend** with navigation, dashboards, and interactive visualizations for each module
4. **Country profile pages** aggregating all five modules
5. **Admin data management** interface for uploading and managing datasets
6. **AI Readiness Index** methodology page with transparent scoring breakdown

Structure the project cleanly with `/app`, `/components`, `/lib`, `/prisma`, and `/types` directories. Prioritize a working, visually polished MVP that demonstrates all five modules with real-looking seed data.

Feel free to adapt the scope or ask me to refine any module before you start building. Let me know if you want to start with a specific module first or build the full scaffold at once.

---

The AI Adoption module is designed to be the differentiator — most agriculture platforms track policy and trade, but very few systematically catalogue and benchmark AI deployment across the continent. The cross-module linkages (AI ↔ PHL reduction, AI ↔ trade competitiveness) are where the real analytical power sits.

Want me to save this as a document you can reuse, or shall we start building Trofi AgriTech right now?
